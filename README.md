This plot shows the relationship between the amount of ethical, or 'just', company
involvement within a US County, as measured by the Just Capital project, and the
degree of income inequality (measured by taking the ratio of income at the 80th
percentile to income at the 20th percentile within a county).

Overall, there is a small correlation between 'just company involvement' and the
'income inequality ratio' within a given county. This is just a relationship within
a single time point of census data and 'Just Capital's ranking of companies, so
causality can not be reasonably inferred. However, the presence of significant
relationships between ranking and income inequality indicate that searching for an
indication of causality by comparing change in income inequality over the tenure
of a company's presence is a promising project.
